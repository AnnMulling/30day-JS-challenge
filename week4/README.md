<p> Today was all about voice! I had a blast learning new things. </p>

<p>🌟 Explored the SpeechSynthesisUtterance web speech API, which controls the content to be read and various reading properties like language, pitch, and volume.

🌟 Created a UI interface to manipulate these API properties seamlessly.

🌟 Used built-in language options for the first time, adding more versatility to my projects.

🌟 Experimented with the .bind() method, which I'd come across before but never actually implemented.</p>


## Day24 Sticky Nav👀

<p> In the "Sticky Nav" lesson, I learned how to create a navigation bar that sticks to the top of the screen as scrolling down a webpage.  Understanding the differences between sticky positioning and other methods like fixed or relative positioning was eye-opening. Additionally, figuring out how to smoothly transition the navigation bar between its regular and sticky states was quite rewarding.</p>


## Day 25 Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once🫧

<p>A memory refresh on event capturing and bubbling phases. Which describe the order in which events are triggered on nested elements. The lesson delved into event propagation, which refers to how events propagate through the DOM tree.  Including these 2 options:</p>

<p>🌟 ”once” : allows event listeners to be triggered only once and then automatically removed.</p>

<p>🌟 ”capture” :  the phase in which an event listener is triggered, in this phase, event travels from the root of the DOM to the target.</p>
