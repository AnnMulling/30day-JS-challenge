<p> Today was all about voice! I had a blast learning new things. </p>

<p>🌟 Explored the SpeechSynthesisUtterance web speech API, which controls the content to be read and various reading properties like language, pitch, and volume.

🌟 Created a UI interface to manipulate these API properties seamlessly.

🌟 Used built-in language options for the first time, adding more versatility to my projects.

🌟 Experimented with the .bind() method, which I'd come across before but never actually implemented.</p>
