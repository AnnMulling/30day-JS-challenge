<p>This neat little project features different keys that produce sounds when pressed.
It's a fantastic way for me to refresh my knowledge of JS DOM manipulation.
Plus, I discovered that syncing audio to HTML elements is surprisingly straightforward!</p>

## Day2 JavaScript Analog Clock Project 🕰️

<p>Today, I worked on making an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML part sets up the clock's structure, like the hands for hours, minutes, and seconds. CSS made it look good, handling stuff like alignment and color. Plus, it used the transform rotate property to move the hands around. The JavaScript part was a little challenging; it controlled how the hands moved based on the time. But hey, I had so much fun ✨designing my clock!</p>

## Day3 Updating CSS with JavaScript 🖼️

<p>
  Today's project involved a simple setup with HTML and CSS. What caught my attention was the utilization of CSS variables,
  something I hadn't experimented with before.
  I delved into using CSS variables and discovered their power in enabling dynamic adjustments via JavaScript.
  It's a 🌟 nifty trick that injects a sense of liveliness and interactivity into the user interface.

## Day4 Array Methods 👩🏻‍💻
<p>
  Today's project was all about JavaScript.  A great refresher on commonly used array methods.
  I stumbled upon some neat ways to showcase data in the console:
  🌟 One standout was **`consoled.table()`**! This function displays tabular data in a well-organized table format. If you haven't tried it yet, give it a shot; you'll be impressed by how neat the output looks!
  🌟 `**Array.reduce()**` to efficiently sum up instances in an array and then display them in an object. It's a handy tool for condensing and processing data.

## Day5 Flex Panels Image Gallery 🏞️

<p>
  Today's project focused on creating a flex panels image gallery where clicking on an image expands it along with transitioning text, smoothly easing in. It was so enjoyable!
  Here are a couple of cool things I learned from this project:
  🌟 Utilizing the **`toggle()`** method with DOMTokenList to seamlessly add or remove tokens from the DOM list.
  🌟 Gaining more hands-on experience with translation and transform properties in CSS.
  And of course, I had a blast choosing images that "kind of" matched the captions! 😻 😸

## Day6 Ajax Type Ahead ❓

<p>
  Today's focus was on practicing regular expressions (Regex), which hasn't been the easiest topic for me to grasp.
  I've tended to avoid using them in the past, but this project gave  me a chance to delve into Regex in a simple, practical, and enjoyable way. 😇
  On top of that, I must say, that the CSS in this project is outstanding! It adds an extra level of visual appeal. 💖
